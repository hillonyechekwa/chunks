<p>The best way to demo a code post is to display a real life post, so check out this one from <a href="https://andy-bell.design/wrote/creating-a-full-bleed-css-utility/">andy-bell.design</a> about a full bleed CSS utility.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes you want to break your components out of the constraints that they find themselves in. A common situation where this occurs is when you donâ€™t have much control of the container that it exists in, such as a CMS main content area.</p>
<p>This is even more the case with editing tools such as the <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">WordPress Gutenberg editor</a>, where in theory, you could pull in a component from a design system and utilise it in the main content of your web page. In these situations, it can be pretty darn handy to have a little utility that makes the element 100% of the viewportâ€™s width <em>and</em> still maintain its flow within its parent container.</p>
<p>This is when I normally pull the <code>.full-bleed</code> utility class out of my back pocket.</p>
<h2>The <code>.full-bleed</code> utility</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s small, but hella mighty:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.full-bleed {
  width: 100vw;
  margin-left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here it is in a context where it makes a fancy <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element bleed out of their parent container.</p>

<p>The <code>.full-bleed</code> utility gives those elements prominence and <em>importantly</em> keeps their semantic place in the page. Just how I like it.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¥ <strong>Pro tip</strong>: When working with a utility like <code>.full-bleed</code>, itâ€™s a good idea to add an inner container that has a max-width and auto horizontal margin. For this, I normal create a shared <code>.wrapper</code> component like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.wrapper {
  max-width: 50rem;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Having a container like <code>.wrapper</code> helps to create consistent, centred content.</p>

<h3>How the <code>.full-bleed</code> utility works</h3>
<p>We set the container to be <code>width: 100vw</code>, which equates to the full viewport width. We couldnâ€™t set it to <code>width: 100%</code> because it would only fill the space of its parent element. The parent elementâ€™s width <em>is</em> useful though, because by setting <code>margin-left: 50%</code>, we are telling the component to align its <strong>left edge</strong> to the center of its parent element, because <code>50%</code> is half of the <strong>parent elementâ€™s</strong> width.</p>
<p>Finally, we use CSS transforms to <code>translateX(-50%)</code>. Because the transform works off the elementâ€™s dimensions and not the parentâ€™s dimensions, itâ€™ll pull the element back <code>50vw</code>, because itâ€™s <code>100vw</code> wide, thus making it sit perfectly flush with the viewportâ€™s edges.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Hopefully this short and sweet trick will help you out on your projects. If it does, <a href="https://twitter.com/andybelldesign">drop me a tweet</a>, because Iâ€™d love to see it!</p>
